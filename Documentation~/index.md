 **Post-processing** is the process of applying full-screen filters and effects to a cameraâ€™s image buffer before it is displayed to screen. It can drastically improve the visuals of your product with little setup time. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties. The images below demonstrate a scene with and without post-processing. ![](Images/home-before_5c46f1e9b5df3b0ec8275c65.png) Without post-processing ![](Images/home-after_5c46f1e9b5df3b0ec8275c68.png) With post-processing
